# SCDCdm - Single-cell differential composition analysis 
SCDCdm allows for identification of compositional changes in count data, especially scRNA-data.
It also provides a framework for reading in and analyzing cell compositions directly from *scanpy*

The statistical methods used are described in:
 
**Johannes Ostner:** *Development of a statistical framework for compositional analysis of scRNA data*
